in these By-laws as the "$FOUNDATION"

### Section 1.2 Principal Office
The principal office of the $FOUNDATION shall be located at 1 Letterman Drive, Suite D4700, San

### Section 1.4 Purpose
(a) The nature of the business or purposes to be conducted or promoted by the $FOUNDATION is
to engage in any lawful act or activity for which corporations that are organized not for profit
may be organized under the General Corporation Law of Delaware. The primary purpose
of the $FOUNDATION
(collectively, "the Purpose") is to: (i) drive widespread adoption and continued development of key
JavaScript solutions and related technologies; (ii) facilitate collaboration within the JavaScript development
community; (iii) create a center of gravity for open source projects throughout the end-to-end JavaScript
ecosystem guiding them toward open governance and diverse collaborator bases; (iv) host the infrastructure
to support hosted open source projects (the "Projects"); (v) enable, through advancement of the $FOUNDATION's projects and strategic partnerships, an open and accessible web; and (vi) undertake such other
activities as may from time to time be appropriate to further the purposes and achieve the goals set forth
above.
(b) The $FOUNDATION will promote the Projects. Subject to Section 13.3, Members are expected to
support the design, development, or application of hardware or software products that will implement one
or more Projects. In furtherance of these efforts, the $FOUNDATION shall seek to solicit the participation of
all interested parties on a fair, equitable and open basis in the Projects.
(c) In support of such purpose, the $FOUNDATION may engage in some or all of the
following activities: (i) drive the development of, disseminate, support and maintain
the Projects; (ii) create and own
distinctive trademarks, service marks and/or certification marks; (iii) administer or subcontract a branding
program; (iv) create various printed and/or electronic materials for distribution to members and non-
members; (v) maintain its own website; (vi) coordinate the promotion of the Projects among members and
non-members, as well as create basic marketing promotional collateral (e.g., both web pages as well as

501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (hereinafter, the "Code"). Until such time, if
ever, as such exemption is denied or lost, the $FOUNDATION shall not knowingly engage directly or
indirectly in any activity that it believes would be likely to invalidate its status as an organization exempt
from federal income taxation under Section 501(a) of the Code as an organization described in Section

thereby) as the Board and/or any committees thereof (each a "Board Committee") may from time to time

commencing for its existing class of Membership.

approved by the Board.

### Section 2.9 Subsidiaries, Etc.

(a)     Only the legal entity which has been accepted as a Member of the $FOUNDATION and its
Subsidiaries (as defined below) shall be entitled to enjoy the rights and privileges of such Membership;
provided, however, that such Member and its Subsidiaries shall be treated together as a single Member.
For purposes of this Section, the term "Subsidiaries" shall mean all Related Companies (as defined below)
that a Member controls or is affiliated with (as defined in Section 2.9(b) below).

(b)      Only one Member which is part of a group of Related Companies shall be entitled to have a

the common control of a third party, in each case where such control results from ownership, either directly
or indirectly, of more than fifty percent of the voting securities or membership interests of the entity in
question; and "Related Companies" are entities that are each a Related Company of a Member.

(c)     No Related Company of a Platinum, Gold, or Silver Member may apply for Membership as a
Platinum, Gold, or Silver Member for so long as the existing Platinum, Gold, or Silver Member retains its
Membership.

(d)       If a Member is itself a foundation, consortium, membership organization, user group or other
entity that has members or sponsors, then the rights and privileges granted to such Member shall extend
only to the employee-representatives of such Member, and not to its members or sponsors, unless otherwise
approved by the Board in a specific case from time to time.

(e)      Memberships shall be non-transferable, non-salable and non-assignable, except that any Member
may transfer its current Membership benefits and obligations to a successor to substantially all of its
business and/or assets, whether by merger, sale or otherwise; provided that the transferee agrees to be
bound by these By-laws, the Certificate of Incorporation and such policies and procedures as the Board
may from time to time adopt.

### Section 2.10 Additional Classes of Members

The conditions, privileges, powers, and voting rights (if any) of any class of Members may be changed, and
one or more additional classes of Membership may be created, and the conditions, voting rights (if any),

powers and privileges of each such class may be prescribed, by amendment to these By-laws in accordance
with Article XIV.

### Section 2.11 Termination or Suspension of Member by $FOUNDATION

Any Member may be suspended from Membership or have its Membership terminated by the Board for
failure to satisfy its Membership Obligations or for engaging in any conduct, either within or without the $FOUNDATION, that is contrary to the Purposes of the $FOUNDATION. Financial Obligations already paid shall
not be refundable upon any such termination or suspension, and all Financial Obligations of such Member
which may be accrued and unpaid as of the date of such termination shall remain due and
payable. Terminations or suspensions of Membership for failure to satisfy Financial Obligations within 60
days of invoice may be imposed with notice and without right of formal appeal under such procedures as
the Board may from time to time approve. Except as provided in the last paragraph of this Section 2.11, no
termination or suspension of Membership for any other purpose shall be effective unless:

(a) The Member is given notice of the proposed termination or suspension of Membership and of the
    reasons therefor;

(b) Such notice is delivered personally or by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by a national or
    international overnight courier service, sent to the last address of the Member shown on the $FOUNDATION's records;

(c) Such notice is given at least thirty days prior to the effective date of the proposed termination or
    suspension of Membership;

(d) Such notice sets forth a procedure determined by the Board (or other body authorized by the Board) to
    decide whether or not the proposed termination or suspension shall take place, whereby the Member is
    given the opportunity to be heard by such body, either orally (and represented by counsel if the
    Member so desires, at its sole cost and expense) or in writing, not less than five days before the
    effective date of the proposed termination or suspension; and

(e) Such termination or suspension of Membership is approved by Super Majority Vote of the Board.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the Board believes in good faith that a Member is engaging
in willful misconduct or otherwise acting to the material detriment of the best interests of the $FOUNDATION
and its Members, the Board, acting by Super Majority Vote, may suspend such Member's Membership
immediately, provided that such Member is otherwise afforded the protections provided for in subsections
(a), (b) and (d) of this Section 2.11.

### Section 2.12 Resignation by Member

A Member may resign as a Member at any time. Any Financial Obligations already paid by such Member
shall not be refundable upon any resignation, including any termination of Membership pursuant to Section
2.11 above, and all such Financial Obligations of such Member which may be accrued and unpaid as of
such date shall remain due and payable. If a Platinum Member gives written notice of non-renewal or
resigns as a Member, or is terminated, the $FOUNDATION shall promptly give notice of such event to all
Members.

### Section 2.13 Levy of Dues, Assessments or Fees

The $FOUNDATION may levy dues, assessments or fees upon its Members in such amounts as may be
approved from time to time by the Board, but shall provide at least thirty (30) days' notice of such levy.
For the avoidance of doubt, no such levy shall be effective until at least thirty (30) days have passed since
the provision of notice. A Member upon learning of any increase in dues, or of any levy of any
assessments or fees, may avoid liability therefor by resigning from Membership prior to the date such dues,

assessments or fees are due and payable, except where the Member is, by contract with the $FOUNDATION
or otherwise, independently and explicitly liable for such dues, assessments or fees. No provision of the
Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws of the $FOUNDATION authorizing such dues, assessments or fees
shall, of itself, create such liability. In no event shall the failure of a Member to pay any dues or
assessments give rise to any claim in favor of the $FOUNDATION for indirect or consequential damages.

### Section 2.14 Use of Names

Unless otherwise provided herein, neither the $FOUNDATION nor any Member shall use the name, logo,
trademark, service mark or other distinctive mark of another Member in any form of publicity without the
written permission of the other Member, provided that the $FOUNDATION and any Member may each
disclose and publicize such Member's Membership in the $FOUNDATION.

### Section 2.15 Rights in Intellectual Property

The Board shall give all Members at least thirty (30) days' notice prior to the adoption of, or any material
change to, any intellectual property rights policy or any other material policy or procedure governing
intellectual property, such that any Member may resign its membership prior to the effective date thereof in
accordance with Section 2.12 above. For the avoidance of doubt, no such adoption or material change shall
be effective until at least thirty (30) days have passed since the provision of notice. A material change shall
be deemed to include, without limitation, the imposition of a patent license obligation on Members, and a
change in the license applicable to Members' contributions.




## ARTICLE III - ACTIONS OF MEMBERS

### Section 3.1 Action Without Meeting
Any action required or permitted to be taken by the Members, or any class of Members
under the General Corporation Law of Delaware, or at any meeting of a Member
Committee, Working Group thereof or 
other group of Members or subset of Members, may be taken without prior notice and without an
in-person vote, if a consent in writing, setting forth the action to be taken, shall be signed by
Members (or all members of a class of Members, as the case may be), making up not less than that
percentage of all Members as would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at
which all Members (or class of Members, as the case may be) entitled to vote thereon were
present and voted, in accordance with Section 2.15(c) of the General Corporation Law of
Delaware. Pursuant to such written consent, the Voting Members shall elect a Board in accordance
with Section 4.3 on an annual basis. Prompt
notice of the taking of any corporate action without a meeting by less than unanimous written
consent shall be given to those otherwise entitled to vote thereon who have not consented in
writing. An electronic transmission consenting to an action to be taken and transmitted by a
Member or by a person or persons authorized to act for a Member or proxyholder, shall be
deemed to be written, signed and dated for the purposes of this Section, provided that any such
electronic transmission sets forth or is delivered with information from which the $FOUNDATION can
determine (a) that the electronic transmission was transmitted by the Member or by a person or
persons authorized to act for the Member and (b) the date on which such Member or authorized
person or persons transmitted such electronic transmission. The date on which such electronic
transmission is transmitted shall be deemed to be the date on which such consent was signed.
Consents given by electronic transmission (i) may be delivered by electronic transmission to the
principal place of business of the $FOUNDATION or to an Officer or agent of the $FOUNDATION having
custody of the book in which actions of Members without a meeting are recorded, need not be
reproduced in paper form, and may be maintained in electronic form as long as they are capable
of being readily reproduced in paper form, and (ii) may be otherwise delivered to the principal
place of business of the $FOUNDATION or to an Officer or agent of the $FOUNDATION having custody of
the book in which actions of Members without a meeting are recorded if, to the extent and in the
manner provided by resolution of the Board.
Any copy, facsimile or other reliable reproduction of a consent in writing may be
substituted or used in lieu of the original writing for any and all purposes for which the original
writing could be used, provided that such copy, facsimile or other reproduction shall be a
complete reproduction of the entire original writing.

### Section 3.2 Nomination and Election Procedures
Subject to the provisions of Section 4.3, the Board shall establish reasonable nomination
and election procedures given the nature, size, and operations of the $FOUNDATION, including a
reasonable means for Members of appropriate classes to nominate a person for election as a
Director, a reasonable opportunity for a nominee to communicate to the Members the nominee's
qualifications and the reasons for the nominee's candidacy (if requested by such nominee), a
reasonable opportunity for all nominees to solicit votes (if requested by any such nominee), and a
reasonable opportunity for all Members entitled to vote thereon to choose among the nominees.

## ARTICLE IV - DIRECTORS

### Section 4.1 Powers; Voting
The business and affairs of the $FOUNDATION shall be managed by its Board, which shall be,
and shall possess all of the powers of, the "Governing Body" of the $FOUNDATION as a not-for-profit
membership corporation under Delaware General Corporation Law. The Board may
exercise all powers of the $FOUNDATION and do all such lawful acts and things as are not by statute
or by the Certificate of Incorporation or by these By-laws directed or required to be exercised or
done by the Members.

### Section 4.2 Number of Directors
(a) Subject to Section 4.2(b) and Section 4.4 below, the total number of Directors shall be the number
of Platinum Members, plus the number of Gold Members divided by three (3) (rounded down to the nearest
whole number but at least one (1) at any time there is at least one (1) Gold Member), plus the number of
Silver Members divided by ten (10) (rounded down to the nearest whole number but at least one (1) at any
time there is at least one (1) Silver Member), plus one (1) (the "Maximum Director
Number"). The Board shall comprise the Directors described in Section 4.3 below.

(b) In no event shall the Maximum Director Number ever exceed two (2) times the number of
Platinum Members.

### Section 4.3 Nomination, Election and Term of Office of Directors

(a)       Each Platinum Member (while remaining in good standing) shall be entitled
individually to appoint one Director (each a "Platinum Director"). Each Platinum Director shall
serve until the next annual action of Members without a meeting and until his or her successor shall be duly
appointed or until his or her earlier resignation or removal.

(b)      Each Gold Member (while remaining in good standing) shall have the right to vote, together with
the other Gold Members as a class, and to elect a number of Directors (each, a "Gold Director") equal to
the greater of (i) one (1) and (ii) the number of Gold Members then in good standing divided by three (3)
(rounded down to the nearest whole number) up to a maximum of three (3); provided that the number of

Gold-elected Board seats do not exceed the number of Platinum-elected Board seats minus one.Each Gold
Director shall serve in accordance with Section 4.3(e) below and until his or her successor is elected and
qualified or 
until his or her earlier resignation or removal. The selection of nominees for such position(s)
shall be performed under such nominating procedures as may be set by the Board from time to time.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in the event that after any annual election of
Directors, the number of Platinum Members decreases, resulting in a corresponding decrease in the
Maximum Director Number, and such decrease causes a situation where the number of Gold Directors
previously elected exceeds the number specified in this Section 4.3(b), then in such event all Gold
Directors previously elected may serve until the next annual election of Directors, at which time the
required decrease in the number of Gold Directors shall take effect.

(c)Each Silver Member (while remaining in good standing) shall have the right to vote, together with
the other Silver Members as a class, and to elect a number of Directors (each, a "Silver Director") equal to
the greater of (i) one (1) and (ii) the number of Silver Members then in good standing divided by ten (10)
(rounded down to the nearest whole number) up to a maximum of three (3); provided that the number of
Silver-elected Board seats do not exceed the number of Platinum-elected Board seats minus one nor the
number of Gold-elected Board seats.

Each Silver Director shall serve in accordance with Section 4.3(e) below and until his or her successor is
elected and qualified or until his or her earlier resignation or removal. The selection of nominees for such
position(s) shall be performed under such nominating procedures as may be set by the Board from time to
time. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in the event that after any annual election
of Directors, the number of Platinum Members or the number of Gold Members decreases, resulting in a
corresponding decrease in the Maximum Director Number, and such decrease causes a situation where the
number of Silver Directors previously elected exceeds the number specified in this Section 4.3(c), then in
such event all Silver Directors previously elected may serve until the next annual election of Directors, at
which time the required decrease in the number of Silver Directors shall take effect.

(d) Any Director nominated, appointed or elected by any class of Members, or by any
Member, may, but shall not automatically, be re-nominated, re-appointed and/or re-elected for
additional terms.

(e) Each Director (other than the TAC Director) shall be an employee of the Member which
nominated or appointed him or her. Each Director (other than the TAC Director) shall hold office until the
earliest to occur of the expiration of the term for which such Director was elected and such Director's
successor is elected and qualified, or until his or her earlier death, resignation, removal or termination of
employment for any reason with the nominating or appointing Member, and in the case of a Platinum or
Silver Director, until the earlier of (i) expiration or termination of Membership of the Member that
nominated or appointed such Director, (ii) the combination, by merger, acquisition or otherwise, of two
Members that each have representatives on the Board, upon which event one of the two representatives, as
designated by the surviving Member, shall be deemed to have resigned, or (iii) if requested by the Board or
the employer of such Director, upon the termination of the employment of such Director by the Member
represented by such Director. In addition, during such times as the Membership of any Member that has a
representative serving as a Director is suspended pursuant to Section 2.10 above, the attendance and voting
rights of such Director representative shall also be suspended until such time, if ever, as the suspension of
such Member is lifted.

(f) Each Platinum, Gold or Silver Director (or the Member that appointed or is the employer of such
Director) may designate in writing (which designation may be withdrawn in writing at any time by such
Director or Member) an individual to act as a Director in his or her stead, whether for a single meeting or as
a standing alternate. Any such alternate Director shall also be an employee of the Member that appointed
or nominated the original Director. Any such alternate Director shall be entitled to (i) attend and vote at all
meetings which the designating Director does not attend, (ii) sign all written consents in lieu of the
designating Director, and (iii) otherwise exercise the duties and enjoy the privileges of the designating
Director in the absence or unavailability of the designating Director; provided, however, that no such
alternate Director may propose a vote or vote upon any Committee of the Board. In addition, in lieu of
making such a substitution, any Director who will be absent for any meeting may deliver a written proxy to
the President, authorizing the President to either vote as instructed in such proxy, or to vote in the stead of
such absent Director in such manner as the President may believe appropriate. Any such proxy shall be
valid only with respect to the meeting and such specific matters (or with respect to all matters, if so desired)
as may be stated in such proxy.

(g) The Board may approve from time to time such reasonable attendance and other
requirements as it shall deem to be advisable to ensure that seats on the Board are held by active,
contributing individuals.  Such rules may provide
that any Member which has appointed or nominated a Director, as the case may
be, may lose its ability to appoint and/or nominate a representative to the
Board in the event that such requirements have not been met, and/or that a
Director who fails to meet such requirements shall automatically be deemed to
have resigned from the Board, but no such rule may be imposed retroactively.

### Section 4.4 Enlargement or Reduction
Subject to Section 2.9 above and Section 4.10 below, the number of Directors, the
persons eligible to become Directors and the classes of Members eligible to appoint, elect and/or
nominate Directors may be amended at any time by a Super Majority Vote (as defined in Section
4.10(b)) of the Board.

### Section 4.5 Resignation and Removal
Any Director may resign at any time upon notice to the $FOUNDATION in writing or by
electronic transmission at the principal place of business of the $FOUNDATION or to the President
or Secretary. Such resignation shall be effective upon receipt unless it is specified to be effective
at some other time or upon the happening of some other event. Any Director who was appointed
by a Member under Section 4.3(a) may be removed by that Member at any time, and for any
reason, or for no reason. Any or all of the Directors who were elected by a class of Members
voting as a class or by the Board may be removed by a majority vote of such class of Members
or the Board, respectively. Unless otherwise specified by law or the Certificate of Incorporation,
any Director may be removed by a majority of the other Directors then in office for engaging
in any conduct, either within or without the $FOUNDATION, that is contrary to the interests
of the $FOUNDATION or to the advancement of the $FOUNDATION's business or industry goals;
provided, however, that the Member or class of Members that appointed and elected or
nominated and elected (as the case may be) such removed Director shall be entitled to appoint
and elect or nominate and elect (as the case may be) a replacement for such removed Director to
serve for the balance of such removed Director's term. The TAC Director shall
automatically cease to be a Director at such time as he or she ceases for any reason to be
the Chair of the TAC.

### Section 4.6 Vacancies

(a) Vacancies on the Board occurring as a result of the death, resignation, removal or
termination of employment of a Director who was appointed and elected by a Member, or who
was nominated and elected by a class of Members, may be filled by such Member or class of
Members, as applicable. All other vacancies shall be filled by the
vote of a majority of Directors then in office, whether or not less than a quorum, or by a sole
remaining Director. The term of a Director so appointed or elected shall be the unexpired portion
of the term of the Director, if any, whom the Director so appointed or elected is replacing.

(b) In the event of a vacancy in the Board, the remaining Directors, except as otherwise
provided by law or these By-laws, may exercise the powers of the full Board until the vacancy is
filled.

### Section 4.7 Place of Meetings

The Board may hold meetings, both regular and special, either within or without the State of Delaware.

### Section 4.8 Regular Meetings

Regular meetings of the Board may be held without notice at such time and at such place as
shall from time to time be determined by the Board; provided that any Director who is absent
when such a determination is made shall be given prompt notice of such determination.

### Section 4.9 Special Meetings

Special meetings of the Board may be called by the President, Secretary, or on the written request of two or
more Directors, or by one Director in the event that there is only one Director in office. Two business
days' notice to each Director, either personally or by telecopy, commercial delivery service, electronic
transmission, or similar means sent to his or her business or home address, or three business days' notice by
written notice deposited in the mail, shall be given to each Director by the Secretary or by the Officer or
one of the Directors calling the meeting. A notice or waiver of notice or any waiver by electronic
transmission of a meeting of the Board need not specify the purposes of the meeting.

### Section 4.10 Quorum, Action at Meeting, Adjournments

(a)      At all meetings of the Board a majority of Directors then in office, shall constitute a quorum for
the transaction of business and the act of a majority of such Directors present at any meeting at which there
is a quorum shall be the act of the Board, except as may be otherwise specifically provided by law, the
Certificate of Incorporation or these By-laws.

(b)     In order to pass a "Super Majority Vote", a resolution must be taken at a meeting of the Board at
which a quorum is present and in support of which two-thirds of all Directors have voted affirmatively, or
by an equivalent 
number of Directors acting by written consent in the manner described in Section 4.11 below. A
Super Majority Vote of the Board shall be required with respect to the following matters:

(i)      Amending the Certificate of Incorporation;

(ii)     Amending or repealing any provision of these By-laws;

such greater number of Directors as may be required by law or the By-laws of the $FOUNDATION for
the taking of any such action at a meeting) consent thereto in writing or by electronic
transmission, and the writing or writings, or electronic transmission or transmissions, are filed
with the minutes of proceedings of the Board, provided that:

(i) such written consent or electronic transmission shall have been sent
simultaneously to all Directors then in office for their consideration;

compensation therefor. The Directors may also approve reimbursement of expenses for members
of Board Committees in connection with their service on such Board Committees.

be employed by any Member organization at the time of appointment. At the conclusion of this initial one
year term and thereafter, the TAC Chair shall be elected by the TAC in accordance with the TAC Charter
and shall serve at the pleasure of the TAC and the Board. The TAC Chair shall automatically be a member

## ARTICLE VII - NOTICES

### Section 7.1 Delivery

(a)       Whenever, under the provisions of law, or of the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-laws,
written notice is required to be given to any Director or Member, such notice may be given by mail,
addressed to such Director or Member, at his, her or its address as it appears on the records of the $FOUNDATION, with postage thereon prepaid. Unless written notice by mail is required by law, the Certificate
of Incorporation or another provision of these By-laws, and subject to the provisions below relating to
notice by electronic transmission to Members, written notice may also be given by electronic mail,
telecopy, commercial delivery service, or similar means, addressed to such Director or Member at his, her
or its address as it appears on the records of the $FOUNDATION. Without limiting the manner by which
notice otherwise may be given effectively to Members, any notice to Members given by the $FOUNDATION
under any provision of law, the Certificate of Incorporation, or the By-laws, unless written notice by mail is
required by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or another provision of these By-laws, shall be effective if
given by a form of electronic transmission consented to by the Member to whom the notice is given.

(b)       Notice given pursuant to this Section shall be deemed given: (i) if by facsimile telecommunication
(A) to a Member, when directed to a number at which the Member has consented to receive notice and (B)
to a Director, when directed to the number for such Director as it appears on the records of the $FOUNDATION; (ii) if by electronic mail to (A) a Member, when directed to an electronic mail address at which
the Member has consented to receive notice and (B) to a Director, when directed to the electronic mail
address for such Director as it appears on the records of the $FOUNDATION; (iii) if by a posting on an
electronic network together with separate notice to the Member or Director of such specific posting, upon
the later of (A) such posting and (B) the giving of such separate notice; (iv) if by any other form of
electronic transmission, when directed to the Member or Director; (v) if by in-hand delivery or oral notice,
at the time it is actually given; (vi) if by mail, at the time when the same shall be deposited in the United
States mail; and (vii) if by commercial delivery carrier or similar means, at the time when the same shall be
deposited with the carrier, in each case the transmission charge to be paid by the $FOUNDATION or the
person sending such notice and not by the addressee. An affidavit of the Secretary or an Assistant
Secretary or of the transfer agent or other agent of the $FOUNDATION that the notice has been given by a
form of electronic transmission shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated
therein.

(c)       For purposes of these By-laws, "electronic transmission" means any form of communication, not
directly involving the physical transmission of paper, that creates a record that may be retained, retrieved,
and reviewed by a recipient thereof, and that may be directly reproduced in paper form by such a recipient
through an automated process.

(d)      Without limiting the foregoing, the $FOUNDATION adopts electronic mail as its principal source of
communication with its Members. Each Member acknowledges and agrees that the $FOUNDATION shall
not be under any obligation (except as required by law or these By-laws) to send any notice to any Member
by any means other than electronic mail, and it is therefore the responsibility of each Member to avail itself
of and make such arrangements as may be necessary to receive notice in such fashion.

### Section 7.2 Waiver of Notice

Whenever any notice is required to be given under the provisions of law or of the Certificate of
Incorporation or of these By-laws, a waiver thereof in writing, signed by the person or persons entitled to
said notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, or a waiver by electronic transmission by the
person entitled to notice, shall be deemed equivalent thereto.




## ARTICLE VIII - INDEMNIFICATION

### Section 8.1 Actions other than by or in the Right of the $FOUNDATION

Subject to confirmation of the appropriateness of such action by the Board as provided in Section 8.4
below, the $FOUNDATION shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a
party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the $FOUNDATION) by reason of the
fact that he or she is or was a Director, Officer, employee or agent of the $FOUNDATION, or is or was
serving at the request of the $FOUNDATION as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments,
fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him or her in connection with
such action, suit or proceeding if he or she acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably
believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the $FOUNDATION, and, with respect to any criminal
action or proceedings, had no reasonable cause to believe this conduct was unlawful. The termination of
any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere
or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a
manner which he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the $FOUNDATION, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his
or her conduct was unlawful.

### Section 8.2 Actions by or in the Right of the $FOUNDATION

procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a Director, Officer, employee
or agent of the $FOUNDATION, or is or was serving at the request of the $FOUNDATION as a director, officer,
employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against
expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him or her in connection with the
defense or settlement of such action or suit if he or she acted in good faith and in a manner he or she
reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the $FOUNDATION; provided, however,
that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall
have been adjudged to be liable unless, and only to the extent that, the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that,
despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and
reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or
such other court shall deem proper.

### Section 8.3 Success on the Merits

To the extent that any person described in Section 8.1 or 8.2 of this Article VIII has been successful on the

fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him or her in connection therewith.

### Section 8.4 Specific Authorization

Any indemnification under Section 8.1 or 8.2 of this Article VIII (unless ordered by a court) shall be made
by the $FOUNDATION only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of
any person described in said Sections is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the
applicable standard of conduct set forth in said Sections. Such determination shall be made (a) by a
majority vote of a such Directors who were not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, even though less
than a quorum or (b) by the Members of the $FOUNDATION.

### Section 8.5 Advance Payment

Expenses incurred in defending a civil or criminal action, suit or proceeding shall be paid by the $FOUNDATION in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an
undertaking by or on behalf of any person described in said Section to repay such amount if it shall
ultimately be determined that he or she is not entitled to indemnification by the $FOUNDATION as authorized
in this Article VIII.

### Section 8.6 Non-Exclusivity

The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, the other Sections
of this Article VIII shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those provided
indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under any By-law, agreement, vote of
disinterested Directors or otherwise, both as to action in his or her official capacity and as to action in
another capacity while holding such office.

### Section 8.7 Jurisdiction of Delaware Court of Chancery

The Delaware Court of Chancery is vested with exclusive jurisdiction to hear and determine all actions for
advancement of expenses or indemnification. The Delaware Court of Chancery may summarily determine
the $FOUNDATION's obligation to advance expenses (including attorney's fees).

The Board may authorize the $FOUNDATION to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person
who is or was a Director, Officer, employee or agent of the $FOUNDATION, or is or was serving at the
request of the $FOUNDATION as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted against him or her and incurred by him
or her in any such capacity, or arising out of his or her status as such, whether or not the $FOUNDATION
would have the power to indemnify him or her against such liability under the provisions of this Article
VIII.

### Section 8.9 Continuation of Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses

The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, this Article VIII
shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a Director, Officer, employee or agent of the $FOUNDATION and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.

### Section 8.10 Severability

determined to be invalid, the provisions hereof shall not otherwise be affected thereby but shall remain in
full force and effect.

### Section 8.11 Intent of Article

The intent of this Article VIII is to provide for indemnification and advancement of expenses to the fullest
extent permitted by Section 145 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware. To the extent that such
Section or any successor section may be amended or supplemented from time to time, this Article VIII
shall be amended automatically and construed so as to permit indemnification and advancement of
expenses to the fullest extent from time to time permitted by law.

rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of Membership or

between the $FOUNDATION and any other corporation, partnership, association, or other organization in

## ARTICLE XIII - ANTITRUST COMPLIANCE

### Section 13.1 General

The $FOUNDATION will conduct all of its activities in conformance with all international, U.S. federal and
state antitrust laws and competition laws, including but not limited to the Sherman Act, the Clayton Act,
the Robinson-Patman Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act and the EU Competition Regulations. The
Board and the President shall consult legal counsel and seek legal review whenever necessary to ensure that
the activities of the $FOUNDATION are conducted in conformance with such laws.

Each of the Members of the $FOUNDATION is committed to fostering competition in the development of
new products and services, and the activities of the $FOUNDATION are intended to promote such
competition. Each Member acknowledges that it may compete with other Members in various lines of
business and that it is therefore imperative that they and their representatives act in a manner that does not
violate any applicable state, federal or international antitrust laws or regulations. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Members that are competitors shall not discuss issues relating to product costs,
product pricing, methods or channels of product distribution, any division of markets, or allocation of
customers, or any other topic that would be prohibited by applicable antitrust laws.

Each Member shall assume responsibility to provide appropriate legal counsel to its representatives acting
under these Bylaws regarding the importance of limiting the scope of their discussions to the topics that
relate to the Purposes of the $FOUNDATION, whether or not such discussions take place during formal
meetings, informal gatherings, or otherwise.

### Section 13.2 Availability of Intellectual Property

It is the good faith objective of the Foundation (a) to make all open source software available promptly as it
is developed and owned by the Foundation on the same terms and conditions to all Members and at the
same point in time to all Members, and (b) to make all such open source software available to all non-
Members under the same open source license(s).


### Section 13.3 No Obligation to Endorse

No Member shall, by reason of its Membership or participation in the $FOUNDATION or otherwise, be
obligated to license from the $FOUNDATION, use or endorse any intellectual property developed or endorsed
by the $FOUNDATION, or to conform any of its products to any code base, specification or platform
developed or adopted by an Project, nor shall any such Member be precluded from independently licensing,
using or endorsing similar intellectual property, platform, software, specifications or documentation
developed by it or by others. No provision of these By-Laws or the membership agreement shall be
interpreted to prevent any Member from using any technology or platform other than technology of the
Projects, or from engaging in other activities or business ventures, independently or with others, whether or
not competitive with the activities contemplated herein or those of any Member


## ARTICLE XIV - AMENDMENTS

Except as otherwise required under these Bylaws, or where such power is expressly limited by law or the
Certificate of Incorporation as to any specific action, these By-laws may be altered, amended or repealed,
and new By-laws may be adopted, in each case by (i) a Super Majority Vote of the Board of Directors or
(ii) the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the Voting Members then in good standing, at any annual meeting

of the Voting Members or regular meeting of the Board of Directors or at any special meeting of the Voting
Members or of the Board of Directors, provided, however, that in the case of a regular or special meeting of
Voting Members, notice of such alteration, amendment, repeal or adoption of new By-laws shall be
contained in the notice of such meeting.
